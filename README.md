# User Story
```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

### Usage

On the right side of the nav bar you will find 4 nav links. The first three will pull you to different points of the page. The last one should take you to my personal github repository. 

The hero image features a button that will take you to my personal linkedin. 

The button on the larger main feature card will take you to my first HTML / CSS project from module 1. The smaller feature card buttons will take you to corresponding wiki pages relating to the material. 

The contact section has links, however they are not connected to anything yet.
